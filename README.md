# Stability-of-Nnaocrystalline-alloys
Abstract: 
•	Nanomaterials have a wide range of scope in green energy applications and few of them are in the field of hydrogen production and storage. 
•	This project focuses on designing binary nano-crystalline alloys containing Aluminium and Magnesium to obtain a stable system which can be utilized for hydrogen production and storage applications.
•	Aluminium and Magnesium were chosen due to high solubility of Hydrogen in these elements
•	The objective of this project is to get a stable system considering the Regular Nano-crystalline System (RNS) model.
